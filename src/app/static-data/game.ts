One has to wonder what brought the position to this; where White was doing well, but then has to give a pawn and hope to draw. Isn't this a mysterious kind of thing? I suppose White was not fully developed and active (Nc2) and holding back to avoid trades gave Black compensation for the other weaknesses in Black's position. In the end it was those same weaknesses which gave White compensation for the lost pawn. It's back to the drawing board to find a better plan for White. }\r\n1/2-1/2\r\n\r\n",

One has to wonder what brought the position to this; where White was doing well, but then has to give a pawn and hope to draw. Isn't this a mysterious kind of thing? I suppose White was not fully developed and active (Nc2) and holding back to avoid trades gave Black compensation for the other weaknesses in Black's position. In the end it was those same weaknesses which gave White compensation for the lost pawn. It's back to the drawing board to find a better plan for White. }"

The thorny light square pawn structure also inhibits Bf1-c4. So, White usually aims for a Classical set-up with Nb1-c3, Bf1-e2, O-O and possibly Bc1-e3. This is one good way to get a \"normal\" Scheveningen position without facing the Sozin (Bf1-c4) , Velimirovic (Bf1-c4, Bc1-e3, Qd1-e2, O-O-O) or Keres Attack (an early g2-g4) .

Unlike variations with ...d7-d6 where Black uses an early ...Ng8-f6 to (more-or-less) force White into Nb1-c3 before c2-c4, in this variation the threat of an early ...Bf8-b4 helps to serve the same purpose. The thorny light square pawn structure also inhibits Bf1-c4. So, White usually aims for a Classical set-up with Nb1-c3, Bf1-e2, O-O and possibly Bc1-e3. This is one good way to get a \"normal\" Scheveningen position without facing the Sozin (Bf1-c4) , Velimirovic (Bf1-c4, Bc1-e3, Qd1-e2, O-O-O) or Keres Attack (an early g2-g4) . The primary cost to avoiding early king-side development (or any preparation to remove Ke8 from the center) is that White has some attacking options. }(4...Nf6)(4...e5 \r\n{ Kalashnikov })(4...Qb6 \r\n{ Benko })(4...g6 \r\n{ Accelerated Dragon })"

There are numerous maneuvers and plans which could produce good results. }\r\n17...d5\r\n{ Apparently White didn't have this thematic move prevented as well as he'd thought. Black blows up the position and makes all White's caution irrelevant; of course, the cost of this is that White's pieces can come to life in the open position too, meanwhile Qh5 isn't really in play.

However, with the Black pieces the two are very different: against 1. e4 Ponomariov has played 1...c5 a few times in this event while Karpov plays 1...c6 or 1...e5. Their understanding of the game might be similar, but Pono has youth and Karpov has tremendous experience. For those who know how to handle it 1...e5 has been doing quite well the last few years. But, that success hasn't been with the Spanish Game as much as with the Scotch Game (by White's choice) or the Russian Game/Petrov's Defense.

Karpov used to play 1. e4, but now only plays 1. d4. However, with the Black pieces the two are very different: against 1. e4 Ponomariov has played 1...c5 a few times in this event while Karpov plays 1...c6 or 1...e5. Their understanding of the game might be similar, but Pono has youth and Karpov has tremendous experience. For those who know how to handle it 1...e5 has been doing quite well the last few years. But, that success hasn't been with the Spanish Game as much as with the Scotch Game (by White's choice) or the Russian Game/Petrov's Defense. Black seeks a little simplification and more open space to develop pieces with both of those. }"
